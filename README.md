# COMP250-A3-Tester

A collaborative test suite for the third assignment of COMP 250 at McGill University (Winter 2021). It includes all the tests from the instructor minitester as well as extra tests written by students.

## Important

Only add TEST CODE here, not actual assignment code. If you accidentally pushed your assignment code, please delete it right away.

## How To Use

- You may clone this repo to your Intellij or your preferred IDE. If you aren't familiar with Git, our amazing TA Sasha made a tutorial https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFvevpoGcNCvjyTjOfPhzqjgb-L_WdX8r
- Worst case scenario, you may also copy paste the code onto a .java file in the default package. It's not recommended since you might miss something, but it's quicker than the last method.
- You may also add new tests and create pull requests.
- Happy coding and debugging!
